## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Juan Manuel CristÃ³bal, a tech enthusiast passionate about practical solutions and innovative ideas.

## What can you find here?

In this blog, I share my knowledge, experiences, and honestly, anything that crosses my mind. I'm just starting this project, so you'll find a bit of everything here: from experiments with DevOps and automation (using tools like Ansible, ArgoCD, and Docker) to ideas about software development and Python projects, such as web applications with FastAPI or artificial intelligence.

This space is designed for developers, engineers, and curious minds who enjoy exploring ideas and practical solutions. But donâ€™t be surprised if something unexpected pops up from time to time. In the end, this blog is both a technical lab and a place to express my creativity.

## My story

I started this blog because Iâ€™ve always believed that sharing knowledge not only helps others but also helps you grow. Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve worked on projects that require creativity and technical precision, and this space is my way of documenting and sharing those experiences.

Outside of technology, I enjoy exploring other interests like music and the little things that make life interesting. Thatâ€™s why youâ€™ll also find a personal touch in every post.
